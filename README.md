## About

*(Please note that this version is rather old by now. A new version with updated technology is in the works.)*

The *Descriptio urbis Romae* (ca. 1450), written by [Leon Battista Alberti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Battista_Alberti) (1404–1472), explains how to create a map of then contemporary Rome. This homonymous application implements the given instructions and allows to draw Alberti's map according to the known manuscripts.
